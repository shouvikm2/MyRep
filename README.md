Architecting the Physical AI Frontier
Senior Systems Architect | Technology Lead | Budding Edge AI Specialist
I am a veteran Technology Lead with 12+ years of experience in high-availability, cloud-native infrastructure, currently pivoting my focus toward Embodied AI and Edge Computing. My mission is to move intelligence out of the cloud and onto the device, prioritizing low-latency inference, privacy-by-design, and resource optimization.
